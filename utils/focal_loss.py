    Softmax version of focal loss.

      where m = number of classes, c = class and o = observation
    Parameters:
      alpha -- the same as weighing factor in balanced cross entropy. Alpha is used to specify the weight of different
      categories/labels, the size of the array needs to be consistent with the number of classes.
      gamma -- focusing parameter for modulating factor (1-p)
    Default value:
      gamma -- 2.0 as mentioned in the paper
      alpha -- 0.25 as mentioned in the paper
